Two Python Programs Attached That Implemnt the Program

- proportional_hypothesis_test.py
Simplfied version of the proportional hypothesis test

- Mining_Proportional_Hypothesis_Test_BreastMuscle.py
Version of python program that got implemented when mining ASE results from chicken based data (HFE vs LFE) utilizing the proportional hypothesis test. Requires various additional files not uploaded at this time perion.
